# Integration Requirements for Religious Gurus

## CopilotKit Integration

CopilotKit would enable us to add an AI assistant directly within our application's interface, providing contextual help and guidance to users as they explore different worldviews.

### Required Changes:

1. **Package Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/react-textarea
   ```

2. **Integration with our existing AI system**:
   - Create a new service to connect our worldview experts with CopilotKit's interface
   - Implement CopilotProvider at the app root level
   - Add CopilotTextarea or CopilotPopover components to relevant pages

3. **Context-aware assistance**:
   - Modify our existing worldview agents to provide context to CopilotKit
   - Pass the current topic or conversation data to the Copilot assistant
   - Update prompts to work within CopilotKit's framework

4. **UI Modifications**:
   - Add a persistent chat interface for the Copilot
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness with the added components
   - Style the Copilot UI to match our application's design

## GMI Cloud Integration

GMI Cloud would provide cloud storage and synchronization for user data, allowing seamless experience across devices and persistent storage of conversation history.

### Required Changes:

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Implement user authentication (if not already present)
   - Create user profiles and session management
   - Add login/signup flows to the application

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Modify our storage layer to support cloud synchronization
   - Update database models to include user ownership of topics and chats
   - Implement background sync for conversation history

3. **API Changes**:
   - Create new endpoints for user data management
   - Update existing endpoints to support user-specific data
   - Implement proper security and access controls for user data

4. **UI Updates**:
   - Add user profile and settings pages
   - Create UI for managing synchronized data
   - Add indicators for sync status

## AgentR Integration

AgentR would enhance our multi-agent system with advanced routing capabilities, improved memory, and more sophisticated agent interactions.

### Required Changes:

1. **Agent Architecture Restructuring**:
   - Refactor our current coordinator and expert agents to use AgentR's framework
   - Implement AgentR's memory system for better context retention
   - Update the routing logic between different worldview experts

2. **Knowledge Management**:
   - Integrate AgentR's knowledge base capabilities
   - Enhance our worldview experts with specialized knowledge bases
   - Implement better context tracking across conversation turns

3. **Group Chat Enhancements**:
   - Leverage AgentR's multi-agent conversation capabilities
   - Improve the coordination between different worldview experts
   - Implement more sophisticated dialogue management

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Update our dependency structure to incorporate AgentR
   - Modify prompt engineering to work with AgentR's expected formats
   - Potentially restructure our database to support AgentR's state management

## Implementation Strategy

The recommended approach would be a phased integration:

1. **Phase 1**: Integrate CopilotKit for enhanced user assistance
2. **Phase 2**: Add GMI Cloud for data synchronization and persistence
3. **Phase 3**: Upgrade our agent architecture to use AgentR

This approach allows for incremental changes and testing each integration independently before combining them into a complete solution.
